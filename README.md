This is a 2 player card game based off the Chinese card game Big-2 that I used to play growing up with my family.
You can find out more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_two.
The original game is played with 4 players, but this version is played with 2 players.

The project was created using Phaser.io, ExpressJS, and Socket.io.
